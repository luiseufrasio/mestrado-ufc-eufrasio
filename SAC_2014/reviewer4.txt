============================================================================

The paper presents a comprehensive method for the construction of wrappers [in
a proper standard representation] that allow the publication of data stored in
DBMS in the Semantic Web.

The paper is quite appropriate for this track as it tackles  a hot problem for
this context and the approach seems fairly original.
However, the techniques appear a bit too "ad hoc" and are only partially
automatized.

The paper lacks of a discussion of the merits of the proposed strategy from a
theoretical viewpoint.
Alternarively an empirical evaluation that proves its effectiveness would be
required.

The paper organization is OK,
however examples and the lists of rules are a bit too long to follow.
