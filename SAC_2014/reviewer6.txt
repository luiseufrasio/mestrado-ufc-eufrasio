Having a language for mapping schemas to rdf triples does not prevent further
work neither on the mapping problem nor on improving the mapping language
itself. This work is an effort towards advancing current R2RML language
through simplifying Mapping Language specification.

The paper comprises of a lot of detail, having a subsection to describe clearly
paper's contribution help readers to more easily understand the main idea of
the paper.  The authors need to include in this section, the definition or
description of "simplifying specification" and how their solution simplifies
R2RML specification.

Since one of main contribution of this paper is automatic R2RML mappings
generation. The emphasis should be put on this section. For example, the
section on R2RML can be dropped, in order to describe in more detail the notion
of "customized mapping generation" and with a fine-grained example.

Other terminologies need more detailed definitions when used for the first
time. These include Exported ontology, SQL mapping, etc.

Section 4.3 uses temples from table 9, before listing and describing these
templates.

Overall the paper contains too much detail, and lucks clear description of the
main idea and contribution.
