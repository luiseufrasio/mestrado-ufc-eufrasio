The authors propose a method to semi-automatic generate R2RML mappings from
relational databases to RDF.

The strong points of the paper are a well-founded theory and a very detailed
approach for generating the mappings.

The weak points are that the paper is hard to read, because sometimes the
reader can be easily lost in the details. Another weak point is that the
evaluation is only done with a small example. The reader cannot get a feeling
how well the approach can generate a suitable mapping. The output of the
approach may be compared with best-efforts mappings from human experts. Of
course, further relational databases should be dealt with in a more
comprehensive evaluation.

However, overall, besides these weak points, the paper is suitable to be
discussed at ACM SAC.
