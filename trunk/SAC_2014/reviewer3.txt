The paper introduces a semi- automatic R2RML mappings. Data bases to RDF and/
or RDF to DB are basic subjects in the Web of Data research domain. However the
too technical presentation of the paper makes the authors’ approach not
clear. I think that this last had to present the mappings with textual simple
rules to show how data can be linked with RDF triples. Also, I propose these
comments to the authors that may help the paper improvement:

1-In the introduction: “the paper has two contributions …” the first
contribution is already given in references [13], a precedent work, and then
the only contribution of the paper may be the second one!

2-Point 3.1: in the third paragraph, line 5: we say that tuples of R (not S)
references tuples of T?

3-What about the evaluation of your proposition? Is this paper an extension
of [8] or the inverse. I don’t understand?
