\section{Introduction}
This SBBD template for short papers is based on the JIDM template, by Alberto Laender and Mirella Moro\footnote{http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~mirella/jidm/templates/}.

Short papers will be presented as posters in an interactive setting and should present interesting and exciting recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas that are not quite ready. Short papers submitted to all tracks can be written in Portuguese or English and must not exceed 8 pages. The papers will be published electronically and indexed by BDBComp. 
 
Papers submitted to SBBD must not have been simultaneously submitted to any other forum (conference or journal), nor should they have already been published elsewhere. The acceptance of a paper implies that at least one of its authors will register for the symposium to present it. Submitted papers will be reviewed based on originality, relevance, technical soundness and clarity of presentation.
Papers exceeding the page limit of the submission type will be automatically rejected without being reviewed by the Program Committee. In addition, all papers must be submitted in PDF format. Formats other than PDF will NOT be accepted. However, exceptionally and upon request, generic postscript might be accepted.

\section{Format}

The first paragraph of every section is not indented. 

The remaining ones are indented.

References to bibliography should be placed in brackets. Here is a reference to a book \cite{Baeza-YatesR99}, a book chapter \cite{BorgidaCL09}, a conference paper \cite{FerreiraGALV09}, a conference paper on a book series (e.g., LNCS) \cite{SilvaLC96}, a journal article \cite{LaenderMNM09}, a PhD thesis  \cite{Moro07} and to information published online \cite{xpath}. In case the URL refers to a software, dataset source or any other information that does not have a proper author, it is better to include it as a footnote, e.g.: "Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Computação: http://www.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br/bdbcomp".
